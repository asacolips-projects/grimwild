        <p><em><strong>Grimwild is a game of cinematic fantasy
        adventure.</strong></em> You go on quests, delve into dungeons, and
        explore the wilderness. It’s set in a world of your choosing, or one you
        create together—the key being it's a world in need of adventurers.
        Grimwild isn't a setting. That's up to you. This game gives you the
        rules, monsters, and adventurers to play a campaign in that setting that
        feels like a fun, ensemble cast TV series, each session a new
        episode.</p><p><em><strong>Gameplay flows smoothly.</strong></em> The
        rules resolve actions quickly, favoring the dramatic over the realistic.
        They provide a strong framework to pace the game, manage tension, and
        create great scenes. They give significant creative freedom to add set
        dressing and even larger details into scenes to play off of, keeping the
        story moving forward and prioritizing common sense over detailed
        tracking.</p><p><em><strong>The story is character-driven.</strong></em>
        As players, you work together to decide your adventuring party's
        identity, then make characters that fit well within it. You set your
        group arcs, then choose your own character arcs, broad themes that give
        you experience when you bring them into play and help steer the
        story.</p><p><em><strong>Characters are revealed through
        play.</strong></em> You start with a clear concept that fits well within
        your party, but you don't necessarily need all of the details
        upfront—focus on what sounds fun to bring into play. You can always use
        the tools the game gives you to add details about your past and connect
        the dots as they come up, leaving plenty of space to grow together into
        a cohesive, colorful party.</p><p><em><strong>Things get
        dramatic.</strong></em> You're rewarded for playing into your traits in
        ways that complicate the situation, giving good reason to think
        in-character and sometimes picking the less than optimal path.
        Inevitably, sparks fly, leading to in-fighting between protagonists,
        just like any great story with characters driven by their own
        motivations. This is all cleanly resolved with quarrels—a simple roll to
        move things forward, encouraging and providing a release valve for this
        friction!</p><p><em><strong>The story is a maelstrom of dice rolls and
        fun ideas.</strong></em> From all this pushing and pulling on the
        narrative, storylines and side plots emerge. In spite of the tension,
        the choices you make about your party's arcs and the characters growing
        together over time give compelling reason to stay together and focused.
        It's a TV show that you're the main characters of, messy and fun and
        full of surprises.</p>

        <p><em>Grimwild</em> is a tabletop roleplaying game, which this book
        assumes you're familiar with. The basics aren't covered here, but there
        are plenty of resources online and you can always join our <a
        href="https://discord.gg/RvmBD2XXXW">Discord community</a> to ask
        questions.</p><p><em><strong>Thematically</strong></em>,
        <em>Grimwild</em> draws heavily on the heroic fantasy of <em>Dungeons
        &amp; Dragons</em> and wears this influence on its sleeve. It’s
        especially rooted in modern <em>D&amp;D</em>, from 3rd edition onwards.
        Inspiration was also taken from <em>Dungeon World</em> and its many
        descendents, like <em>Unlimited Dungeons</em>, <em>Chasing
        Adventure</em>, <em>Homebrew World</em>, and
        <em>Stonetop</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Mechanically</strong></em>, the
        <em><strong>Moxie</strong></em> system that <em>Grimwild</em> is built
        on draws from a variety of character-driven games, with the biggest
        influences being <em>Burning Wheel</em>, <em>Cortex Prime</em>,
        <em>Blades in the Dark</em>, and <em>Fate</em>.</p><h2>To Play, You
        Need</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Players</strong>: You need one person as the
        gamemaster (GM) and some players, <em>ideally three or four</em>.
        Guidelines for solo and duet play are in <em>Ch. 7: Extras</em>
        (@XX).</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Time</strong>: Sessions work best
        at 3 hours. For longer sessions, consider using
        <strong>downtime</strong> (@XX) to break them up and reset per-session
        rules.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Rules</strong>: All players
        should know the core rules, including GM rules. They're short, free, and
        referenced on the sheets. It makes play go much more
        smoothly.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Understanding</strong>: Read
        the rules once, then re-read them again. They'll make more
        sense.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Dice</strong>: Each player needs
        4-6 d6s, notated as <em><strong>d</strong></em> (<em>e.g., 2d, 4d</em>),
        and 2-4 d8s, called <strong>thorns </strong>(@XX) and notated as
        <em><strong>t</strong></em> (<em>e.g., 1t, 3t</em>). The GM needs 8
        d6s.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sheets</strong>: Character, GM, and
        reference sheets are available at drivethrurpg.com (though you might
        prefer the sheets in this Foundry system!). A smaller version of the
        blank character sheet can be found in the
        back.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Safety</strong>: To help everyone
        feel comfortable with the themes within your campaigns, use the TTRPG
        Safety Toolkit: <a
        href="https://bit.ly/ttrpgsafetytoolkit">bit.ly/ttrpgsafetytoolkit</a>.</p></li></ul><h2>Conventions
        in this Book</h2><ul><li><p><strong>System Terms</strong>: These are
        <strong>bolded</strong> when first introduced or when clarity is needed.
        Otherwise, they're not specifically styled. Emphasis is shown with
        <em>italics</em>, sometimes <em><strong>boldly</strong></em>. When
        unsure, reference the index in the
        back.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Pools (@XX)</strong>: In Grimwild,
        "pool" always refers to diminishing pools (@XX), differing from its
        broader use in other RPGs.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>D66
        Tables</strong>: These are 6x6 random tables. Roll 2d6: one die for the
        tens place, the other for the ones place (<em>e.g., 1 and 3 is 13 or
        31</em>). Look at both results (<em>13 = column 1, row 3; 31 = column 3,
        row 1</em>) and choose the one that grabs
        you.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Crucibles (@XX)</strong>: These are
        d66 tables that provide a few words to smash together for inspiration.
        Interpret them literally or figuratively. Re-roll if needed. They can be
        created in Foundry by going to the Roll Tables tab of the sidebar and
        using the <strong>Create Crucible</strong>
        button.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>The Reader</strong>: This book
        addresses the reader as "you," typically from the player perspective. In
        Chapter 3 (@XX), "you" is the GM
        perspective.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Made with Moxie</strong>:
        Most of chapters 1 and 2 are the core Moxie system.</p></li></ul>

        <p><em>Grimwild</em> is built with the <em><strong>Moxie</strong></em>
        cinematic toolkit, a tabletop RPG ruleset that focuses on cinematic
        action and character-driven gameplay. Below is how the key parts tie
        together and an intro to the game's terms. The rules are explained
        throughout chapters 1 and 2, followed by <em><strong>examples of
        play</strong></em>. The game uses a lot of its own terminology, so
        here's a <em><strong>basic rundown of the key parts</strong></em> which
        you'll encounter throughout the rules. Don't worry about understanding
        all of this right now!</p><h2>Setting up the Game</h2><p><em><strong>As
        a group</strong></em>, form an <strong>adventuring party</strong> by
        choosing a few key words that clearly say <em>what your party is</em>
        and <em>what it's not</em>. Your PCs have already adventured together,
        each fitting into the party concept in some way. This cuts right to the
        story in progress, ready to jump into your next adventure.</p><p>Make
        characters by choosing two <strong>backgrounds (@XX)</strong> that
        reflect your past, like your heritage and professions, along with an
        <strong>adventurer path (@XX)</strong> that grants a powerful
        <strong>core talent</strong>. Assign <strong>stats (@XX)</strong>,
        <strong>traits (@XX)</strong>, and <strong>desires (@XX)</strong>, then
        forge <strong>bonds (@XX)</strong> with the other PCs. Establish group
        and character <strong>story arcs (@XX)</strong>, which you play towards
        to drive the story.</p><h2>Playing the Game</h2><p><em><strong>As a
        player</strong></em>, describe what your character thinks, feels, and
        does. When you try something risky, you make an <strong>action roll
        (@XX)</strong>. When the GM puts you in direct danger, you make a
        <strong>defense roll (@XX)</strong>. You can also make a <strong>montage
        roll (@XX)</strong> to skip past parts you don’t want to play out in
        detail. Rolls are made with a handful of d6s equal to a stat, keeping
        the highest to set the <strong>outcome (@XX)</strong>:
        <strong>perfect</strong>, <strong>messy</strong>, or
        <strong>grim</strong>. Rolling two 6s is a <strong>critical
        (@XX)</strong> and you choose a bonus. Difficulty and damage add one or
        more d8s called <strong>thorns (@XX)</strong> to your roll, which might
        <strong>cut (@XX)</strong> the outcome down a level. If a grim gets cut,
        it’s a <strong>disaster (@XX)</strong> and things get really bad for
        you!</p><p>Use your creative freedom to add <strong>set dressing
        (@XX)</strong> to scenes to play off of, and a narrative currency called
        <strong>story (@XX)</strong> to declare significant <strong>story
        details (@XX)</strong> to push the fiction. Earn <strong>spark
        (@XX)</strong> by introducing character-related complications called
        <strong>tangles (@XX)</strong> and facing adversity, then spend it to
        gain a bonus on rolls.</p><p>After each session, you earn
        <strong>experience (@XX)</strong> (XP) towards increasing in
        <strong>level (@XX)</strong>, which grants new <strong>talents
        (@XX)</strong>.</p><h2>Running the Game</h2><p><em><strong>As the
        GM</strong></em>, present dilemmas and drama, then let the players come
        up with solutions. Keep the spotlight moving to give everyone screen
        time and prompt the players to describe their actions. Map the fiction
        to rules, and make rulings to fill in gaps. Open the door wide for
        collaboration and enjoy the story.</p><p>Use <strong>GM moves
        (@XX)</strong> as tools and guiding principles to act as the world and
        pace the story. <strong>Impact moves (@XX)</strong> hit the PCs with
        direct consequences. They require <strong>prompting</strong> from
        <strong>foreshadowing</strong>, grim rolls, or by spending
        <strong>suspense (@XX)</strong>, gained from making <strong>suspense
        moves (@XX)</strong> or holding off on making a prompted impact
        move.</p><p>Make <strong>story rolls (@XX)</strong> to disclaim
        decision-making and use the
        <strong>@UUID[Compendium.grimwild.gm_toolkit.JournalEntry.czz9p07Cxj5KiIQu]{GM
        crucible}</strong> to help come up with ideas. Control the camera to
        create a cinematic feel, zooming in and out on what’s important. Use
        <strong>diminishing pools (@XX)</strong> to create and track tension and
        <strong>challenges (@XX)</strong> to represent the toughest, most
        interesting obstacles PCs face.</p>
