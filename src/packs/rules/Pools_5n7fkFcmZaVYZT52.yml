        <p>A set of d6s used to track things like time, resources, or effort.
        When triggered (ðŸŽ²), roll the pool and <strong>drop</strong> 1d for each
        1-3 result. At 0d, the pool depletes and the fiction changes.</p><p>The
        size of a pool is <strong>4d</strong>/<em>short</em>,
        <strong>6d</strong>/<em>mid</em>, or <strong>8d</strong>/<em>long</em>.
        At <strong>0d</strong>, an event occurs, a situation ends, or a resource
        is depleted. Make sure to reflect the fictionâ€”if a pool and the fiction
        don't match up, adjust or scrap the pool.</p><p>â—† If no dice are dropped
        from a task pool on a messy or perfect action roll, instead <strong>take
        a secondary effect</strong> <em>(they spill a secret, some mooks
        die)</em>. If the pool roll was only 1d and it didn't drop, you can
        instead
        <strong>@UUID[Compendium.grimwild.rules.JournalEntry.i7KRerD2wyqcWclD]{Push
        Yourself}</strong> to drop the last die. In similar cases, the GM can
        <strong>spend
        @UUID[Compendium.grimwild.gm_toolkit.JournalEntry.r03swtJF4sEnG2fm]{Suspense}</strong>
        to drop the last die.</p><p>â—† <strong>Drop</strong> 1d from the pool
        before rolling it when a talent tells you to do so, you have potency, or
        you take the <em>greater effect </em>critical bonus. This
        stacks.</p><p></p><p>Pools can be flexibly applied in many situations,
        usually by the GM. Some typical pools are listed below. Others are found
        throughout the book.</p><p><strong>TIMER POOLS</strong>. Events
        unfolding in the background. ðŸŽ² Key moments, time passing, or a few PCs
        take action. <em>6d Reinforcements Arrive, 8d
        Sunrise.</em></p><p><strong>PRESSURE POOLS</strong>. Threats becoming
        more likely. ðŸŽ² Impact moves, major events, or threat level. <em>6d
        Lookouts Spot You, 8d Corruption Grows.</em></p><p><strong>TASK
        POOLS</strong>. Effort to overcome tasks. ðŸŽ² Task progress, usually an
        action roll. <em>4d Barroom Brawl, 6d Tracking Quarry, 8d Escape the
        Guards.</em></p><p><strong>RESOURCE POOLS</strong>. Quantity of
        something precious. ðŸŽ² The resource sees significant usage. <em>4d Food
        Supplies, 8d Manpower Left.</em></p><p></p><p><em>Note: Pools are always
        notated with the size of the pool in front of it, usually written in
        italics.</em></p>
