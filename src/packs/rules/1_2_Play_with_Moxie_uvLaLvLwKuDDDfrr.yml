        <p><em>Grimwild</em> is built with the <em>Moxie</em> ruleset and
        designed for <strong>cinematic gameplay</strong>. The heart of that is
        <em><strong>narrative collaboration</strong></em>. It's all about
        creating a <em>shared imagination space</em>, <em>managing the
        spotlight</em>, and <em>diving into narration</em>. The rules will get
        you halfway there—they're all pointing towards keeping the pace flowing
        quickly and the action dramatic. The other half is in your hands, the
        players at the table, and the attitude you all approach the game
        with.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Trust in the collaborative process.</strong></em>
        Everyone at the table adds details into the story. You have to work
        together and play off of each other or the game, and the story you're
        telling, will fall flat.</p><p><em><strong>Use the camera, your shared
        imagination.</strong></em> Each player has two perspectives, from your
        character and as the audience watching this TV show. Use the camera and
        vivid description to paint a cool scene in everyone's
        mind.</p><p><em><strong>Tell us what it looks like, before and after
        your rolls. </strong></em>Give details about what you do, don’t just
        leave it at broad statements. Zoom in and out. Use the camera to show
        things outside of your own character as well—pan around, cut to other
        scenes, and describe NPCs. Invoke cinematic vibes and create great
        scenes.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Don’t be a weasel.</strong></em> Do what your character
        would do, then let the GM map it back to the rules. Don’t overdo it
        trying to work your way into better rolls. The fun is letting the story
        flow naturally. When you ask the rules what happens next, follow where
        it points with enthusiasm.</p><p><em><strong>Separate player and
        character knowledge.</strong></em> It’s more fun when everyone knows
        what’s going on in the game. Don’t keep secrets from each other, keep
        them from characters. As a player, be aware of what your character knows
        and doesn’t know and play towards both.</p><p><em><strong>Use the
        meta-channel sparingly.</strong></em> This is conversation about the
        game between players. It’s unavoidable, but minimize it to keep that
        shared imagination in sync at the table. For anything longer than a
        quick question, call for a pause to talk things through, a clean break
        point to resume from later.</p><p><em><strong>Know the
        rules.</strong></em> Everyone can get a copy of the game PDF (<em>it's
        free!</em>). The rules say a lot about the types of stories to be told
        with the game, and the less time you spend talking about the rules, the
        more time you have for roleplaying. Making a cheat sheet on rules you
        often forget can be a big help, or even just skimming the book
        pre-game.</p>

        <p>Think of the game as a series of improv prompts, posed by yourselves
        and the rules. When you respond to them, consider the
        following:</p><ul><li><p><em>What would my character
        do?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What would make for a cool
        scene?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What would move the story
        forward?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What opens the door to get others
        involved?</em></p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Don’t talk yourself out of
        fun.</strong></em> The first idea that jumps into your head is often the
        one you should go with. Don’t overthink or rationalize yourself out of
        it. Like any great TV show character, go where the fun lies. Great
        stories involve excitement, danger, and hard
        choices.</p><p><em><strong>Open doors and step through
        them.</strong></em> The best scenes involve characters playing off of
        each other, so make chances for others to get involved. When someone
        invites you into a scene, step through that door—even if it means a bit
        of mental gymnastics to justify your character’s actions. And as long as
        you step through the door at times, remember that it can be just as
        interesting to close the door instead.</p><p><em><strong>Work the
        spotlight.</strong></em> There’s no turn order of any kind, but there is
        screen time. Strive to make sure everyone gets their fair share,
        including yourself.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Grab the spotlight</strong>
        when there’s a lull or you have a great
        idea.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Share the spotlight</strong> by
        opening doors or following up on another PC’s
        actions.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Pass the spotlight</strong>
        when you’ve been holding it too
        long.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Point the spotlight</strong> to
        see another PC’s response or what they’ve been up
        to.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Never steal the spotlight</strong>.
        Everyone works hard to set up their
        moment.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Don't play to win, play to tell
        stories.</strong></em> Work towards the same goal—to tell a great story
        where everyone's character has a chance to grow. Failure isn't losing,
        it's just another opportunity to have a great scene. Of course, your
        character wants to succeed! However, your goal as a player is keeping
        the story interesting. Play into the bad luck just as you do the good to
        help ensure you craft compelling stories.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Leave lots of blank space.</strong></em> Your PC starts
        with a past and connections to the world, but it's best as latticework.
        Learn who they are through play. Leave space for the other PCs and story
        to fit in.</p><p><em><strong>Don’t be afraid to change.</strong></em>
        PCs often go through hell. Any dramatic story has adversity. Let what
        happens change who they are. Announce what your PC's thinking,
        especially big shifts. If nobody else at the table knows, it’s not
        really happening in that shared imagination.</p><p><em><strong>Don’t be
        afraid to stay the same.</strong></em> Some aspects of your character
        might be immutable. That’s also part of what makes a great character.
        There can be those things they will stick to, even to the bitter end.
        Just make sure it’s worth it, and fun. Don’t die on small hills—<em>die
        on entertaining ones</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Make time for smaller
        moments.</strong></em> Quiet time, a conversation about nothing,
        introspection, reflection—these make for great scenes to flesh out your
        characters and the world. Don't just rush from action scene to action
        scene.</p><p><em><strong>Most importantly, do stuff!</strong></em> Find
        reasons to get into the spotlight, push story arcs forward, and make fun
        scenes. When there's no opportunity, add some details to the story to
        create one!</p>
