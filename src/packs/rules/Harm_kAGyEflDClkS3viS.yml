        <p>A hard hit to your mind or body, general damage that doesn't need to
        be tracked in detail. <em><strong>This is the default damage from an
        impact move</strong></em>.</p><p>◆ Physical damage leaves you
        <strong>bloodied</strong>.</p><p>◆ Mental damage leaves you
        <strong>rattled</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Bloodied and rattled each
        inflict +1t on all rolls</strong></em>. However, when you have harm, you
        ignore thorns from marks to the related stats, though the marks don't
        clear on the roll. Getting bloodied or rattled a second time leaves you
        <strong>dropped</strong>—you're out of the scene. Make a story roll
        (<em>usually 2d</em>) to see if you're just out temporarily, take a
        condition <em>(4d dying, broken leg)</em>, or wind up
        dead.</p><p>Although bloodied and rattled are the default, especially
        dangerous attacks with <strong>dire stakes</strong> can lead straight to
        dropped, while <strong>tame stakes</strong> situations might leave you
        with a mark by default.</p><p>A messy defense roll leaves you with
        lesser damage <em>(dropped</em>→<em>bloodied,
        rattled</em>→<em>mark)</em>.</p>
