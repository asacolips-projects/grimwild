    <p>Two small spheres of your magic path float around you. Give them 2
    traits: <em>annoying—capricious—malevolent—mesmerizing—whimsical</em>. They
    serve as touchstones. You can sacrifice one to: <em>assist without
    risk—distract someone—send a brief message far away—suffer vex in your
    stead</em>. Make story rolls to determine effects if sacrificed. They return
    each session.</p>
