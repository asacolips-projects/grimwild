    <p>Before each session, use the Herbalism Crucible to make two herb names
    <em>(snakeberry, blastbane)</em>. You have <em><strong>1 minor potion of 1
    and 1 major potion of the other</strong></em>. The name is the touchstone.
    They lose effect after the session. One time only, you can have 1 mythic
    potion <em>(choose after rolling)</em>.</p>
