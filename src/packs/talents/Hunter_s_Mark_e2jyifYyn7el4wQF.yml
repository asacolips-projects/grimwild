    <p>Twice per session, you can declare a weakness in a non-humanoid creature.
    Describe what you know or see, tagging it with a <em><strong>2d
    Weakness</strong></em> pool. When anyone targets the weakness specifically,
    you roll the pool as bonus dice on their roll. As it depletes, the creature
    learns to hide its weakness, causing it to shift its behavior. <strong>Take
    spark</strong> when a Weakness die rolls a perfect (not the overall
    result).</p><p><em><strong>Prowess</strong></em>: Take +1d at stealth,
    traversal, setting traps, and tracking.</p><hr /><p><strong>GROWTH</strong>:
    Every 2 levels, you can use Hunter's Mark one more time per session.</p>
