    <p>Once per session, you can touch someone to link your spirits. You can
    sense their feelings and always know where they are. You can <strong>push
    yourself</strong> to: <em>assist them—speak into their mind—take mental
    damage for them—teleport to them</em>. If they get dropped, so do you. You
    must touch again or rest for the link to end. When it does, change <em>(or
    create) </em>your bond with them.</p>
