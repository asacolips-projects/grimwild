    <p>You manifest a small magical creature, an extension of yourself. You can
    communicate telepathically and send it on simple tasks, making a story roll
    to see how it goes. By entering a trance, you can use its senses. You can
    also <strong>push yourself</strong> to cast a spell through it. If your
    familiar takes damage, it vanishes and reappears at the start of the next
    session.</p>
