    <p>When you take physical damage, only a disaster can drop you. You can get
    bloodied multiple times. Each extra time inflicts +1t on rolls. These extra
    thorns can never be ignored <em>(e.g., Frenzy and Oathsworn talents)</em>
    and they also apply thorns to any attempt to heal you.</p>
