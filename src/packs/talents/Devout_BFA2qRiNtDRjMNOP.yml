    <p>Intelligent creatures recognize you as a person of deep honesty and only
    your most hated enemies would treat you with a lack of respect or doubt your
    word. You are never serious- ly injured or killed by an enemy, unless they
    have no choice. Any creature with speech will always hear you out. This aura
    is upheld by your unwavering commitmentâ€”you must <strong>push
    yourself</strong> to act in bad faith <em>(no free activation).</em></p>
