    <p>You can shift into the form of any beast you're familiar with. You have a
    <em><strong>4d Wild Shape</strong> </em>resource pool, rolled when you
    shiftâ€”at 0d, you fail to turn into that form. The pool replenishes after
    each scene.</p><p>You take on the form's physical qualities and feral
    instincts. Move your stat points around to represent this, with a min. of 1
    and max. of 3 in a stat. You lose access to any talent related to your own
    physical form.</p><p>Some forms are more difficult to shift into. For each
    <em><strong>wild talent</strong> </em>(max 2) a form has, drop 1d from the
    pool before rolling it. These are things like <em>aquatic</em>, <em>smaller
    than a cat</em>, <em>bigger than a bear</em>, <em>venomous</em>, and
    <em>flight</em>. It can also be a specific talent from a path, or anything
    that would require a heritage talent. The GM judges the <em><strong>gray
    zone</strong></em>.</p><hr /><p><strong>GROWTH</strong>: Every 2 levels,
    increase your Wild Shape pool by 1d.</p>
