    <p>Create your patron, a powerful otherworldly being you've made a pact with
    to gain gifts in exchange for obligations.</p><p><strong>Gifts</strong>:
    Your patron actively or passively meddles in your affairs. Before each
    session, roll 2d and write these results down as Gifts. During the session,
    you can replace <em>any </em>rolled d6 <em>(by anyone) </em>with one of your
    gift results, then erase the Gift.</p><p>You can also cast cantrips with
    your patron's trappings as touchstones, useful as <em>set dressing </em>and
    <em>cantrip utility</em>. <em><strong>You gain a bonus talent</strong></em>,
    and each of your talents is infused with their
    trappings.</p><p><strong>Obligations</strong>: Each patron has different
    demands. You have an extra story arc to represent their demands. Some
    patrons expect meaningful progress, while others ask only for the lightest
    of service. You define what this means. Before each session, discuss this
    story arc. Your patron has an <em><strong>8d Patience</strong> </em>pool.
    Roll it if your patron was not satisfied with your progress last session. At
    0d, your patron will give you a visit in some form to <em><strong>clear up
    the issue</strong></em>, replenishing the pool.</p><hr
    /><p><strong>GROWTH</strong>: Every 3 levels, gain a bonus talent, but
    decrease max Patience by 2d.</p>
