    <p>You draw power from an oath you swear to uphold until you die. Your oath
    is comprised of <strong>three core tenets</strong> which dictate your
    behavior. You don't take thorns from bloodied or rattled, instead taking +1d
    on rolls with the related physical or mental stats. Each session, you also
    have <strong>3 smite</strong>. When attacking someone in combat or argument,
    you can spend it 1-for-1 to drop dice from a task pool
    <em><strong>after</strong> </em>rolling
    it.</p><p><strong>Affirmation</strong>: Each session, you can
    <em><strong>give spark to one player</strong> </em>who joined a scene
    involv- ing your tenets, whether they followed them or tried leading you
    astray. When a tenet is in violation, discuss the toll that has had on you
    and think on a chance for atonement. <strong>Take 1 less smite</strong> for
    each tenet in violation. When you atone, <strong>take spark</strong>.</p><hr
    /><p><strong>GROWTH</strong>: Every 2 levels, increase smite by 1.</p>
