    <p>You have spellcasting ability. You roll Wits to cast and the spell
    theorem you are casting serves as its touchstone. You know 4 spell theorems
    inscribed in your spellbook, created using the Spell Crucible. Each session,
    you can cast 4 spells and 2 potent spells. You choose which spell theorem to
    use when you cast.</p><p>You can learn new spell theorems from studying and
    experimenting with scrolls, which you might find as treasure or obtain from
    other wizards. This consumes the scroll.</p><hr
    /><p><strong>GROWTH</strong>: Every 2 levels, increase the castings of
    spells and potent spells per session by 1 and create 1 new theorem with the
    Spell Crucible.</p>
