    <p>Your body itself is a weapon, and <em>anything </em>in your hands is
    merely an extension of it. You never suffer thorns due to weapon matchups.
    Once per session, you can <em><strong>interrupt</strong> </em>with a:
    <em>philosophical point—quick reaction—stunning strike</em>. Each scene, you
    have <strong>4 flow</strong>. You can spend it to:</p><p>◆ Ignore difficulty
    thorns from: <em>being outnumbered</em>—<em>a single powerful
    opponent</em>.<br />◆ Attempt a <strong>fluid maneuver</strong>. Before
    rolling, declare you want to also: <em>disarm them—redirect
    momentum—reposition you, them, or both</em>. On a perfect or messy, it
    happens. <br />◆ Pull off a <em><strong>potent feat of mystical
    grace</strong></em>, like <em>running across water </em>or <em>falling
    harmlessly from a great height</em>. <em>For 1 more flow</em>, extend this
    to those you're touching.</p><hr /><p><strong>GROWTH</strong>: Every 3
    levels, increase flow by 1 per scene and interrupts by 1 per session.</p>
