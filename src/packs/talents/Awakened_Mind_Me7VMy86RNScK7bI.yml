    <p>You have spellcasting ability. Choose 2 bastions below, which act as
    touchstones for your psionic magic. You roll two stats combined to cast,
    forming the roll by adding the bastion's key stats and subtracting two
    (<em>3 Brawn and 2 Wits = 3d</em>).</p><p>Each session, you have <strong>8
    power points</strong>. Spend 1 power point to cast a spell. You can
    <strong>augment</strong> it by spending 1 or more points to: <em>cast a
    potent spell—take +1d (max once) on the roll—ignore thorns from damage—add
    another of your bastions as a touchstone</em>.</p><hr
    /><p><strong>GROWTH</strong>: Every 2 levels, learn a new bastion and gain 2
    power points per session.</p>
