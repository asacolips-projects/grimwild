    <p>You have three small helpers you created. Each has a different
    descriptor, an adjective that determines what tasks they can do. Each
    session, each has a <em><strong>2d power pool</strong></em> you roll to
    perform tasks. When assisting, they roll 1d of their pool. They can follow
    simple commands, without which they will simply search for you.</p>
