    <p>Once per scene, you may awaken a living natural feature — plants,
    animals, insects, fungi, or the like — within or nearby the scene. It gains
    awareness and purpose, forming a <em><strong>3d power pool</strong></em> you
    can direct, guided by its nature. One time only, you can make this a
    ritual-level effect.</p>
