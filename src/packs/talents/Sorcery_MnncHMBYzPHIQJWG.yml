    <p>You have spellcasting ability. You roll Presence to cast and your magic
    paths and tech- niques serve as touchstones. Choose any 4 below (<em>or make
    a magic path up with the GM</em>), with at least 1 magic path and 1
    technique:</p><p><strong>Magic paths</strong>:
    <em>blood</em>—<em>decay—flame—frost—lux—shadow—stone—tempest.</em></p><p><strong>Techniques</strong>:
    <em>attack—create—defend—enhance—hinder—influence—transform—traverse.</em></p><p>You
    can cast spells at-will, though they always carry risk and require a roll.
    When you cast, each spell must combine at least one magic path and one
    technique as touch- stones. You can push yourself to cast a
    <em><strong>potent spell</strong></em>, but gain no free activation of
    it.</p><p>When casting, rolling two or more 1s (including thorns) triggers a
    secondary <strong>wild surge</strong>—raw magic spirals out of your control.
    <em><strong>Make a 2d story roll</strong> </em>to see what happens. The
    effect might stem from your touchstones, raw magical essence, or something
    chaotically random. Use the GM crucible or ask around your group for
    ideas.</p><hr /><p><strong>GROWTH</strong>: Every 2 levels, gain a new
    technique or magic path.</p>
