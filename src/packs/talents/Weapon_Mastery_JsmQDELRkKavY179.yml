    <p>Choose a fighting style that you have mastered:
    <em>brawling—dual-wielding—one-handed weapons—ranged weapons—thrown
    weapons—two-handed weapons</em>. You have a <strong>mastery</strong>
    <strong>die</strong>, a special d6. When you fight in your style, take +1d
    <em>(the mastery die) </em>on the roll. If the mastery die is a 6, it counts
    as a critical. If it's already a critical, <strong>take</strong>
    <strong>spark</strong>.</p><hr /><p><strong>GROWTH</strong>: Every 3 levels,
    your mastery die increases by 1d.</p>
