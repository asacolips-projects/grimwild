        style="font-family:'Capito04VARItalic'"><em><strong>Map fiction to
        rules</strong>. </em></span><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'">Encourage players to focus on the
        fiction and let you handle the rules. The more narratively important
        something is, the more mechanical weight you should give
        it.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Capito04VARItalic'"><em>In a
        game of courtly intrigue, slaying a dragon might be a montage roll for a
        knight while an important dinner party is a complex linked challenge
        full of dire stakes.</em></span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'">Get creative applying the rules,
        mixing them up in ways not explicitly laid out. Don't be afraid to
        tinker. </span><span style="font-family:'Capito04VARItalic'"><em>Moxie
        </em></span><span style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'">is modular and
        you're not going to break it. Graft on rules from other systems you
        like, or hack </span><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VARItalic'"><em>Moxie </em></span><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'">and make it your
        own.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'">If the rules
        clash with what makes sense in the fiction, the fiction wins. Engage
        with the rules quickly, resolve them, and return to the
        story.</span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VARItalic'"><em>"What does that look like?"
        or "Give us a quick scene."</em></span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VARItalic'"><em><strong>Make rulings to fill
        gaps</strong>. </em></span><span style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'">The
        rules are a flexible framework and designed not to cover every detail.
        When things fall through the cracks, try to interpret the rules' intent
        and make a ruling that fits the moment. If it's a judgment call, tell
        the players. If you're unsure of a rule, make a quick call now and check
        later. When in doubt, everything can collapse down to a single story
        roll—ask the players what they want to happen, then roll to see if
        that's how it goes down.</span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VARItalic'"><em><strong>Pace the game
        cinematically</strong>. </em></span><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'">Keep the game flowing like a
        well-paced movie. Don't let scenes drag, </span><span

        something more interesting. If players don't seem keen on an upcoming
        situation, suggest a

        don't</strong>. </em></span><span style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'">The
        GM moves can be explicit rules, merely guidelines, or somewhere in
        between. Some GMs will call them out by name, while others never bring
        them up at all. Either way, as long as your GMing aligns with their
        intent, you're doing it right.</span></p><p><span

        impact</strong>. </em></span><span

        makes victory even sweeter.</span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'">A single impact move is flexible. You
        can split it up into a few lesser effects </span><span

        multiple PCs at once, or have a PC's action affect a totally different
        PC, though they do get a defense roll in that case.</span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'">When an impact move doesn't naturally

        timing.</span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VARItalic'"><em><strong>Prompt player
        narration</strong>. </em></span><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'">After a roll, make sure the players
        narrate how things play out—even, or </span><span

        great way to express their character. Collaborate, but keep them

        other as well, especially with
        @UUID[Compendium.grimwild.rules.JournalEntry.odkrgM4X8udAbLNN]{Assists}
        and montages. Ask for reaction shots as other PCs' scenes play out to
