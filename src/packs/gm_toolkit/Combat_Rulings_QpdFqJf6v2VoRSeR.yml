        fiction to the rules just like any scene, making rulings to fill in
        gaps. However, in combat you'll often see the same scenarios come up, so
        for the sake of consistency, some common rulings:</span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'"><strong>Movement</strong>: Moving
        usually accompanies another actionâ€”the goal isn't just to get somewhere,
        but to get there and do something. If an interesting obstacle blocks the
        way, it needs an
        @UUID[Compendium.grimwild.rules.JournalEntry.pmTv1Nbggk6ql92W]{Action
        Roll}.</span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'"><strong>Weapons</strong>: Compare the
        weapons in play and use common sense to resolve any issues. Most weapons
        are evenly matched; the roll only shifts if there's a clear
        imbalance.</span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'"><strong>Melee combat</strong>: Most
        melee attacks use Brawn, while light, fast weapons rely on Agility.
        Dirty tricks call for Wits, but rarely work more than
        once.</span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'"><strong>Ranged combat</strong>:
        Precision attacks roll Agility, while thrown weapons use Brawn or
        Agility based on weight and range. Charging an enemy with ranged weapons
        is reckless, adding +1t or requiring a separate action to close the
        gap.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'"><strong>Ranged
        and Casters vs. Melee</strong>: Spellcasting and precise ranged attacks
        demand focus, which is tough with nearby threats. Inflict +1t to these
        rolls when under immediate danger.</span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'">@UUID[Compendium.grimwild.rules.JournalEntry.FCERIjA706QgIWIJ]{Defense
        Rolls}: The GM selects the stat to test. Melee attacks are dodged with
        Agility, blocked with Brawn (using armor or shields), anticipated with
        Wits, or keeping your nerve with Presence.</span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'"><strong>Armor</strong>: Armor and
        shields are represented by talents like Bulwark. Otherwise, they are
        @UUID[Compendium.grimwild.rules.JournalEntry.uLhjdcEsx67R7ADM]{Vantage}
        and </span><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VARItalic'">@UUID[Compendium.grimwild.rules.JournalEntry.l1bIcnawFgjunvcF]{Set
        Dressing}<em> </em></span><span style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'">for
        defense rolls.</span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'"><strong>Vulnerabilities</strong>:
        Exploiting a vulnerability can lower
        @UUID[Compendium.grimwild.rules.JournalEntry.CKZHOS0pAZTYwZQ9]{Thorns},
        drop 1 before rolling a
        @UUID[Compendium.grimwild.rules.JournalEntry.5n7fkFcmZaVYZT52]{Pool}, or
        even bypass the need for a roll. In some cases, finding a vulnerability
        is required to attack at all.</span></p><p><span
        style="font-family:'Capito04VAR'"><strong>Enemy Magic</strong>: Enemy
        magic doesn't follow the same rules as PC magic. It manifests through GM
        moves and is constrained only by the
        fiction.</span></p></div></div></div>
