## Compatible Foundry versions

![Foundry v13.351](https://img.shields.io/badge/Foundry-v13.351-green)

## Slow XP
- Added new **Slow XP** system setting. When enabled, XP thresholds are doubled.
- Each XP checkbox will require one click to halfway fill, and a second click to fully fill.

## Token Initiative
- Added new **Token Actions** system setting to support the Token Initiative variant rule.
- If this setting is enabled, the action counter in the combat sidebar will instead represent the two actions each character has each round. Resetting the actor's action count or advancing to the next round will reset this back up to 2.
- Added tokenActions field to actors that can be used to track remaining actions each round. This can be added as a resource to the actor's token, displaying it as a progress bar on the actor.

## Crucibles
- Extended the RollTable class to add support for Crucibles. This can be enabled by switching a roll table's sheet to the Grimwild Crucible sheet. However, this can lead to potential data issues with that table (crucibles need _exactly_ 36 entries), so the better way is to use the new **Create Crucible** button on the roll table sidebar to create new crucibles.
- Added a custom `@CRUCIBLE[uuid]{Label}` enricher that uses the same format as content links that are dragged and dropped into a rich text area. This enricher will display the crucible along with a button to roll it. The easiest way to use it is to drag a crucible roll table from the sidebar or compendium into a rich text area (like a description or journal entry) and then replace `@UUID` with `@CRUCIBLE`.
- Added several crucibles as both roll tables and journal entries that collect related crucibles using the new enricher:
  - GM Crucibles
  - Spellcraft Crucibles
  - Herbalism Crucibles
- Updated talents that refer to the above crucibles to link to journal entries that display them along with buttons to roll them. You'll need to reimport the talents onto your characters to use them!

## Miscellaneous
- Also updated combat tracker to work with the harm pools house rule if that setting is enabled.
