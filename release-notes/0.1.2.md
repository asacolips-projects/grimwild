## Changes

- Added **Linked Challenge** actor type, loosely based on the **Monster** actor type
- Renamed **Equipment** to **Arcana**
- Updated **Challenge** items to have schema fields (traits, moves, failure states) and updated them to use the vue item sheet. Also updated the layout for challenges on monster sheets to use columns, similar to the rule book.
