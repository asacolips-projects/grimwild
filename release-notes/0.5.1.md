## Changes
- Refactored harm handling in chat to better support the optional harm pools homebrew rule.
- Updated harm buttons in chat to not disable them on click. This allows multiple harm to be applied to a single character, or applying the harm from a single roll to multiple characters (such as on an assist).
- Added wild surge compendiums for the sorcerer and updated relevant talents.
- Update spark to always appear on chat messages for action rolls.
- Added text on chat messages with disasters to indicate that spark is granted from them.
